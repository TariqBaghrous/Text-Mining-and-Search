# Text-Mining-and-Search

This project is dedicated to a comprehensive text mining procedure aimed at extracting valuable information from WikiHow, a dataset of more than 230,000 articles and summary pairs extracted and constructed from an online knowledge base written by different human authors.
The project was developed on Python, applying the following text mining tasks: Topic Modeling and Text Summarization. Each task required a specific Text Representation in formats conducive to computational analysis.
Lastly, We utilize a spectrum of evaluation metrics to assess the performance of our models and ensure the relevance and interpretability of the extracted insights.
